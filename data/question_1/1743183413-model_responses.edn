Providing high-quality training and professional development opportunities for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) is a key priority for me and my Department. \n\nThe role of the SNA is vitally important in supporting students with additional care needs to access education and reach their full potential. It is crucial that SNAs are equipped with the appropriate knowledge, skills and competencies to fulfil this role effectively.\n\nCurrently, the minimum qualification required to become an SNA is a fetac level 3 major award in health/special needs support or an equivalent qualification. However, I acknowledge that more can be done to strengthen and standardize the training and professional development opportunities available to SNAs.\n\nThat is why I have asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive review of SNA training and qualifications. This review will examine the current training arrangements, identify areas for improvement, and develop proposals to enhance the training, induction and continuous professional development of SNAs. \n\nThe review will be conducted in close consultation with key stakeholders, including school leaders, SNA representative bodies, and training providers. The aim will be to ensure that all SNAs receive high-quality, relevant training before entering the classroom, as well as ongoing support and development opportunities throughout their careers.\n\nI am committed to delivering this review and implementing its recommendations within the lifetime of this government. Investing in our SNA workforce is crucial to delivering the best possible support and outcomes for students with additional needs. I look forward to working with the Deputy and all stakeholders on this important agenda.", :price-in 0.25, :name "Claude 3 Haiku", :context?
