The Government has taken several steps to support GPs and ensure the sustainability of general practice in all areas across the country.

As I mentioned earlier, training for GPs has expanded over the years, which has helped to increase the number of GPs practicing in the State. Additionally, measures have been implemented to increase the number of GPs, allowing patients across the country to access GP services.

A Strategic Review of General Practice, conducted with input from key stakeholders, is currently underway. This review aims to examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice and set out the necessary measures to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future. The review will focus on addressing issues related to GP capacity, among other concerns.

While specific details about these initiatives are not available at this time, I can reassure you that the Government is committed to supporting GPs in order to ensure that primary care services remain accessible and of high quality for all citizens.
