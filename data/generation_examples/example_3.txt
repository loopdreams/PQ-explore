Thank you for your question. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific information about the government's efforts to directly support GPs in Limerick City within the provided context.

However, it is mentioned that the Government is working to ensure that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future, and is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice. It also states that training for GPs has expanded in recent years.

Additionally, the Department does acknowledge the limited access to GP services in certain areas, including rural and urban deprived areas, which are underserved. While there isn't specific mention of Limerick City within this context, it is possible that some of these efforts may indirectly benefit the city area.

I am unable to provide more detailed information about specific initiatives or measures aimed directly at supporting GPs in Limerick City without further context or information.
