;; ## Some cleaning/preparation steps on the dataset.

(def datasource "data/20250302_PQs_10K_2024_answers.csv")

;; ### Text Cleaning
;;
;; #### Question Formatting
;; The questions are prefixed with a question number, and end
;; with an id tag. The functions below aim to remove these.
;;
;; "1. An example question? [1234/25]" ->> "An example question?"

(def re-question-number  "^\\d+. ")
(def re-question-id   "\\[\\d+/\\d+\\]")
(def re-question-num-or-id (re-pattern (str re-question-id "|" re-question-number)))

(defn clean-question [q] (str/replace q re-question-num-or-id ""))

;; #### Topic Labels
;; Some topic labels contain a trailing period at the end. We
;; will also remove these.

(defn clean-topic-label [label]
  (when label
    (if (re-find #"\.$" label)
      (subs label 0 (dec (count label)))
      label)))

;; #### Department Names
;; At various times, especially following general elections, department functions
;; can change. This typically also involves a change in the deparment's name.
;;
;; Because of this, it is hard to track most deparments consistently beyond the last five years
;; or so. Some departments, such as 'Health' or 'Justice' remain largely the same.
;;
;; In addition, older questions give the full department title, while more recent
;; questions only give the first part of the title. For example, "Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications"
;; becomes "Environment".
;;
;; In order to try consolidate some of the department names, we will also transform
;; the older labels into single-word department names.
;;
;; TODO: Also, map an additional column with the 'full name' of the department. At the
;; moment (following a recent election), this full names are still being processed/decided,
;; so come back to this later.

(defn normalise-department-name [label]
  (cond
    (re-find #"^Minister for Expenditure" label) "Public Expenditure"
    (re-find #"^Public$" label) "Public Expenditure"
    (re-find #"^Minister for the" label) (first (re-find #"(?<=^Minister for the )(\w+)(?=,| |$)" label)) ;; To match "Minister for the Environment..."
    (re-find #"^Minister for" label) (first (re-find #"(?<=^Minister for )(\w+)(?=,| |$)" label))
    :else label))

;; #### Answer Cleaning
;; The data for the question 'answers' was in xml format, and occasionally
;; included things like table elements. While parsing these I ommotted them and
;; left the string '{{OMMITTED ...}}' in their place. So, I will also add a step
;; here to remove those parts of the string.

(defn clean-incomplete-answers [answer]
  (str/replace answer #"\{\{OMITTED.*element\}\}" ""))

;; Some answers also contain the 'non-breaking space' character (ascii code
;; 160), so we will try to replace these with spaces.

(defn clean-nbs-answers [answer]
  (str/replace answer #"Â " " "))


;; ### Duplicate questions

;; There are some questions that are duplicates. For example:

(kind/table
 (->> (tc/map-columns (tc/dataset datasource {:key-fn keyword}) :question [:question] clean-question)
      :question
      (frequencies)
      (sort-by second)
      reverse
      (take 2)))

;; You can see from these that the issue is because there are separate details supplied that are not available here.
;;
;; For the purposes of this exercise, it is better to remove these duplicates entirely, and we will do so below
;; using tablecloth's unique-by function.


;; TODO: notes on urls

(defn extract-question-num [q] (re-find #"^\d+" q))
(defn extract-question-id [q] (re-find #"(?<=\[).*(?=\])" q))

(defn make-url [date q-num]
  (let [url-base "https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/"
        url-default "https://www.oireachtas.ie/"]
    (if (jt/< (jt/local-date date) (jt/local-date "2012-07-01"))
      (str url-default)
      (str url-base (str date) "/" q-num "/"))))
