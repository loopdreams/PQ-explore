;; ## Introduction [Intro text]


;; ## Building a Vector Database from the Questions

;; We will first use langchain4j to transform question text into vector embeddings. The model
;; we will use is provided by langchain4j.

(def model (AllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModel/new))

(def questions-list (:question ds))

;; Let's look at a single embedding for reference.

(->> (TextSegment/from (first questions-list))
     (. model embed)
     (.content))

;; As you can see, it is a very long vector of floating points representing the text.
;;
;; In order to store the embeddings in a database, we will use an in-memory database provided
;; by langchain4j. There are also options for using a more robust solution like postgres, but
;; for testing/exploration purposes, an in-memory database will do.

(def db-store (InMemoryEmbeddingStore/new))

;; A short function for adding a question to the store.

(defn add-question-to-store! [question store]
  (let [segment (TextSegment/from question)
        embedding (->> segment (. model embed) (.content))]
    (. store add embedding segment)))

;; Finally, adding all the questions to the store. The mapping, which has side effects, is wrapped in a 'count' function
;; just so we can see at the end how many questions have been added.

(count (map #(add-question-to-store! % db-store) questions-list))

;; ## Testing Lookup

;; Next, let's try to use the database to return similar questions from the database.

(def test-question (first questions-list))

test-question

;; It's a very generic question...

(defn query-db-store [text n]
  (let [query (.content (. model embed text))
        result (. db-store findRelevant query n)]
    (map (fn [entry]
           {:text (.text (.embedded entry))
            :score (.score entry)})
         result)))

(kind/table
 (query-db-store test-question 5))

;; Let's try with a made-up question

(kind/table
 (query-db-store "The Deputy would like to ask the Minister about schemes relating to climate change." 5))

;; Finally, let's also try with a more focused question

(-> ds
    (tc/select-rows #(= (% :topic) "Dublin Bus"))
    :question
    first
    kind/md)

(def test-question-2 "The Deupty asked the Minister about Dublin Bus Route 74 and what their plans for this route are.")

(kind/table
 (query-db-store test-question-2 5))

;; Two of the five questions relate to the national bus service (Bus Eireann) as opposed to Dublin Bus, but overall
;; it is quite close.

;; ## Answering a Question
;;
;; Let's finally use this method to return the best answers based on the question given. This
;; approach could be later used to provide context for a RAG model that would generate answers.

(defn get-answers-for-question [question]
  (let [matching-questions (map :text (query-db-store question 5))]
    (-> ds
        (tc/select-rows #(some #{(% :question)} matching-questions))
        (tc/select-columns [:answer :date]))))

(kind/table
 (get-answers-for-question test-question-2))


;; Using just chatgpt, here is how a sample answer might possibly be generated:
;;
;; > The Minister stated that while he is responsible for public transport policy and funding, the day-to-day operations, including Dublin Bus Route 74, fall under the National Transport Authority (NTA). He has therefore referred the Deputyâ€™s question to the NTA for a direct reply.

;; ## Question Similarity Across the Database
;;
;; For this exploration, we will take the first 100 questions, and count how
;; many questions are in the database based on similarity

(def test-questions (take 100 questions-list))


(defn count-similar-questions-above-threshold [question threshold]

;; At a threshold of 0.75, 6 of the sample questions have more than 600 other similar questions
;;
;; Let's look at these questions

(filter (fn [question] (> (count-similar-questions-above-threshold question 0.75) 600))
        test-questions)

;; They all relate to Education/schools

;; Let's look at the two questions that have greater than 14 similar questions with a 90% threshold

;; Next, let's try to write a function to count the level of similarity among a topic group.
;;
;; The idea here is to:
;;
;; 1. Create a mini-store of all the questions related to a topic
;;
;; 2. Check each question against this store, and count it if it has at least 1 (excluding itself) question that is similar to it, based on a threshold
;;
;; 3. Calculate the percentage of questions that have at least one other similar question
